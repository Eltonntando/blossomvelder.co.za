Blossom Velder pty Ltd was founded by Ntando Elton Molemi the founder and director of the company after he realised his skills and how he could impact the business world in a way that would change things for the better. The name blossom represent blossoming flowers which in this case the blossoming flowers are all the businesses we work with and we are the bees that aid the blossoming of the flowers which are all the businesses as mentioned, and the Velder comes from the Low-veld term which is used to separate the parts of the Mpumalanga province into the low-veld and the high-veld. Ntando Elton the founder loved the whole idea about bees pollinating plants so that the blossomed flowers may begin fruiting and that connects him to the core of the business as it’s a part of hem. While it has been in the graphic design business for some time, it was in 2019 that we decided to launch Blossom Velder pty Ltd.
